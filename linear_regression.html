								<h1>
									Project overview
								</h1>

								<ul>
									<li>This is a Machine Learning Project of the Telsa Stock price dataset (from 2020 to 2022).</li>
									<li>A linear regression method was used to predict the past prices using historic values as reference.</li>
									<li>The project was made for educational purpose and his values are not an investment advice</li>
									<li>The tools used are the next Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Plotly and Sk-Learn.</li>
									<li>All the procedures details are recorded in a Jupyter Notebook.</li>
									<li>The prices was obtained from the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/" target="_blank"> Yahoo Finance site</a>  </li>
									<li>All the files can be downloaded from my <a href="https://github.com/dquerales/DataScience/tree/main/Predicting%20Stock%20Prices%20with%20Linear%20Regression" target="_blank">GitHub
										Repository.</a></li>
								</ul>

								<h1>
									Objectives
								</h1>

								<p> The goal was to train a machine learning model that tries to predict TSLA stocks prices in a range of the two past years. The data used
									correspond to the period of 2020-2021 to understand how the pandemic is currently affecting the performance of the company. </p>

                                <h1>
									Data transformation and preparation
								</h1>
							    
								<p> All the data was taken from <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/" target="_blank"> Yahoo Finance site</a> as a CSV. Only was
								used data from 01/01/2020 to 26/01/2022. </p>

                                <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
								<p>For the analysis of the stock prices, we need to explore the following representations:</p> 
									<h2>Candle Chart</h2>
									    <p> First, we need a candlestick chart to describe price movements of a security, derivative, or currency. Each candlestick represents all four important information for that day:</p>
									    <ul> 
											<li>Open: The price of the stock when the market opens in the morning </li>
											<li>Close: The price of the stock when the market closed in the evening </li>
											<li>High: Highest price the stock reached during that day </li>
                                            <li>Low: Lowest price the stock is traded on that day </li>
										</ul>
										<span class="image featured"><img src="images/stocks/candle_chart.png" alt="" /></span>

										<ul> 
											<li>The TSLA stock price has growth 800% between 2020-2022.</li>
											<li>The max value was 1243$ in November, 2021.</li>
											<li>The min value was 70$ in March 2020.</li>
										</ul>

									<h2>Adjusted Close</h2>
										<p> The adjusted close is the closing price after adjustments for all applicable splits and dividend distributions. </p>
										<span class="image featured"><img src="images/stocks/adj_close.png" alt="" /></span>

									    <ul> 
											<li>The adjusted close price had a positive slope in the period of study.</li>
										</ul>

									<h2>Volume</h2>
										<p>Volume measures the number of shares traded in a stock or contracts traded in futures or options. Volume can indicate market strength, as rising markets on increasing volume are typically viewed as strong and healthy. 
											When prices fall on increasing volume, the trend is gathering strength to the downside. </p>
										<span class="image featured"><img src="images/stocks/volume.png" alt="" /></span>

										<ul> 
											<li>The volume had a spike in February, July and December of 2020.</li>
										</ul>

									<h2>Market Capitalization</h2>
										<p> Market capitalization (or market cap) is the total dollar value of all the shares of a company's stock. 
											To calculate a company's market capitalization, multiply its stock's current price by the total number of outstanding shares. </p>
									    <span class="image featured"><img src="images/stocks/market_cap.png" alt="" /></span>

										<ul> 
											<li>The Market capitalization had his highest value in December, 18, 2020.</li>
										</ul>

									<h2>Volatility</h2>
										<p>Comparison between the changes in prices each day</p>
									    <span class="image featured"><img src="images/stocks/volatility.png" alt="" /></span>
									
									    <ul> 
											<li>The volatility was around 5% per day.</li>
										</ul>

									<h2>Moving Averages (50-200 days)</h2>
										<p> In statistics, a moving average is a calculation to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set. It is also called a moving mean or rolling mean and is a type of finite impulse response filter. 
											Variations include: simple, cumulative, or weighted forms. </p>
									    <span class="image featured"><img src="images/stocks/m_avg.png" alt="" /></span>

										<ul> 
											<li>The 50-200 days averages were positive most of time.</li>
										</ul>

									
								<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
									<h2>Linear Regression Model</h2>
										<p> To predict the past prices of the stock, was used a linear regression. This means a linear approach 
											for modelling the relationship between the prices. </p>

										<ul>
											<li>The data was split in train and test sets, using 8:2 ratio.</li>
                                            <li>The input was Open, High, Low and Volume. Also using the date as index</li>
											<li>The model score using the test data was around 98% </li>
										</ul>
									    <span class="image featured"><img src="images/stocks/predict_ml.png" alt="" max-width: 100%;
											height: auto; /></span>
                                
								<h1>Conclusions</h1>
								<ul>
									<li>The all time High value was 1243$ at 2021-11-04.</li>
									<li>The all time Low value was: 70$ at 2020-03-18</li>
									<li>The Max volume was 304M$ at 2020-02-04</li>
									<li>If we would have invested in the TSLA stock, at start 2020, we had today a return of 8X.</li>
									<li>The machine learning model was around 98% of accuraccy for predicting test values.</li>
									<li>This model is only used for educational purpose. In reality, the market volatility nature makes extremely difficult to anticipate the rise and fall of the stocks.</li>
